# 2D and 3D Transformation Visualizer

An interactive tool for visualizing 2D and 3D transformations, including translation, rotation, and scaling. This project is ideal for understanding basic graphics transformations and is a foundational tool for learning computer graphics.

## Features
- **2D Transformations**: Visualize translation, scaling, and rotation on a 2D shape.
- **User Controls**: Adjust transformation parameters in real-time through an interactive interface.
- **3D Extension (Coming Soon)**: Expand the project to 3D transformations using WebGL or Three.js.

## Demo
Add a link here if you deploy the project online, e.g., using GitHub Pages.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run this project locally, you need:
- A web browser (latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, or Safari recommended)
- Basic knowledge of HTML and JavaScript (optional, for understanding the code)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/2D-3D-Transformation-Visualizer.git
   cd 2D-3D-Transformation-Visualizer
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your web browser to view the 2D visualizer.

3. To work on the 3D transformation visualizer, refer to the `src/3D/transformations3D.js` file. For this, it’s recommended to use a local server if you’re working with WebGL/Three.js for compatibility.

## Usage

1. **2D Transformations**:
   - Open the project in a browser.
   - Use the controls below the canvas to:
     - **Translate** the shape along the X and Y axes.
     - **Scale** the shape.
     - **Rotate** the shape.
   - Watch the transformations happen in real-time on the canvas.

2. **3D Transformations** (Future Work):
   - Set up Three.js in `src/3D/`.
   - Implement controls for 3D translation, rotation, and scaling.
   - Add objects to the scene and adjust lighting as needed.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5 Canvas**: For rendering 2D shapes.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing transformations and interactive controls.
- **Three.js** (planned): For 3D transformations.

## Future Enhancements
- **3D Transformation Visualizer**: Implement WebGL or Three.js for a 3D experience.
- **Additional Shapes and Textures**: Support for more complex shapes and texture mapping.
- **Export Functionality**: Allow users to save or export transformation parameters.
